It's nice to sit together by the fire.
I mean, I'm not cold... but this is what you do when you are homeless right?
We're homeless.
The circles took our home and forced us to live on the street.
But we are getting by. As long as we have each other.
Hey, thanks for sitting by the fire with us. It really means a lot to us because we are homeless.
