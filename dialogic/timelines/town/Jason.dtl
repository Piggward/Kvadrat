	Jason: I'm Jason! My father kicked me too far into the alley...
	Jason: Oh, dont worry! It's not as bad as it sounds. Since I am a circle its only natural to kick me like a football. 
	Jason: Kicking a child like a football is kind of like pushing a baby in a stroller.
	Jason: Anyways, now I cannot come out... Could you kick me out again?
	Jason: It's easy! Just imagine that you are pushing a large container full of rotten fish around... Kind of.
